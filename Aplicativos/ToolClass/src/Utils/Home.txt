ToolClass is an office automation resource for its use, simulation, understanding and analysis of information, referring to the tools present in the drilling process. The results of these simulations and instrumental analysis include definitions, dimensions, materials of manufacture, which are accompanied by a photographic component of a wide variety of drilling tools.

Currently, it is necessary to become familiar with all the scenarios present in the oil industry, and more specifically in drilling tasks, which is why this academic proposal is presented to the educational community on this occasion.
