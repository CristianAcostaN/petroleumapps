Water drive:

The aquifers may be so large compared to the reservoir they adjoin as to appear infinite for all practical purposes, and they may range down to those so small as to be negligible in their effects on the reservoir performance. The reason for the small decline in reservoir pressure is that oil and gas withdrawals from the reservoir are replaced almost volume for volume by water encroaching into the oil zone.
