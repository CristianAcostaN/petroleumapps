Gas Cap Drive:

The natural energy available to produce the crude oil comes from the following two sources:

- Expansion of the gas cap gas.
- Expansion of the solution gas as it is liberated.

The reservoir pressure falls slowly and continuously. Oil recovery by gas cap expansion is actually a frontal drive displacing mechanism.
