The oil formation volume factor is a measure of the degree of change in oil volume as it is produced from the reservoir and brought to surface conditions. In the subsurface formation, pressure as well as temperature is significantly higher than stock-tank conditions. As oil is produced, it undergoes shrinkage or reduction in volume due to the liberation of dissolved gas. The effect is greater in the case of highly volatile oil due to the abundance of light hydrocarbons.
