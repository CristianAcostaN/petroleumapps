The amount of gas dissolved in a unit volume of oil at a specified temperature and pressure is defined as the solution gas oil ratio. When the reservoir pressure is above the bubble point, all of the available gases are dissolved in oil, leading to a maximum and constant solution gas oil ratio. Below the bubble point pressure, the liberation of gas bubbles from crude oil reduces the solution gas oil ratio (see Fig. 1.1). It is well known that the solution gas oil ratio strongly depends on the reservoir pressure, reservoir temperature, oil density, and gas density.
