Viscosity is one of the most important characteristics of hydrocarbons in the operational aspects of production, transportation, refining and petrochemicals. Viscosity is obtained by various methods and is designated by various measurement values. The effect of temperature on the viscosity of crude oils, in the reservoir or at the surface, is very important, especially concerning heavy and extra-heavy crude oils.
