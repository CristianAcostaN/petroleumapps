Viscosity

Although viscosity is a property with many applications, it is not used to characterize light and medium oils. to characterize light and medium oils. Gas-phase chromatography is by far the most expedient analytical by far the most expedient analytical technique to know the composition of light and medium oils.
light and medium oils.

In the compositional study of heavy (and extra-heavy) crude oils, gas chromatography is by far the most expedient analytical technique to know the composition of light and medium oils. gas-phase chromatography is not an expeditious technique because the "non-chromatographable" fraction is usually
"fraction is usually up to 50% of the oil.
