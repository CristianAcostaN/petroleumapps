The effect of temperature on the viscosity of a liquid is markedly different from the effect on a gas; in the case of gases, viscosity increases with temperature, whereas in the case of liquids, it invariably decreases markedly with increasing temperature. As the temperature of the crude oil increases, its viscosity decreases due to the increase in the velocity of the molecules and, therefore, both the decrease in their cohesive strength and the decrease in the molecular resistance to displacement.
