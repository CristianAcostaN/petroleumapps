The effect of mechanical pressure increases the viscosity. If the increase in pressure is effected by mechanical means, without the addition of gas, the increase in pressure results in an increase in viscosity. This behavior is due to the fact that the distance between molecules is decreasing and, consequently, the resistance of the molecules to move is increasing.
