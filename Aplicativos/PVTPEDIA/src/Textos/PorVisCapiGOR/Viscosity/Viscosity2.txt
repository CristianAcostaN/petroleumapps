Oil viscosity (Âµo) is one of the most important physical properties that directly controls and influences fluid flow through porous media and production tubing. Viscosity, in general, is defined as the internal resistance offered by the fluid to flow or movement. In the case of heavy and extra heavy crudes the orders of magnitude can vary from 1000 cps to more than 100,000 cps; from a practical point of view, in order to understand the impact of this variable on fluid mobility we make a comparison with other common substances.
