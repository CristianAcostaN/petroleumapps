The solution GOR is a PVT property of the crude oil system. It is commonly referred to as “gas solubility” and denoted by Rs. It measures the tendency of the gas to dissolve in or evolve from the oil with changing pressures. It should be pointed out that as long as the evolved gas remains immobile, i.e., gas saturation Sg is less than the critical gas saturation, the instantaneous GOR is equal to the gas solubility. That is:
