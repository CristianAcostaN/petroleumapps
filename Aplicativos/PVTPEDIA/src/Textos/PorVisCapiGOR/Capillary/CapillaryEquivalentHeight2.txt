Equivalent height is inversely proportional to the difference in densities between two immiscible phases. The thickness of the transition zone between the wetting phase and the nonwetting phase is the difference in equivalent height between the wetting phase contact (the uppermost depth in the reservoir where wetting phase saturation is 100%) and the height where the wetting phase saturation is irreducible. For example, the thickness of the oil–water transition zone is the difference in equivalent height between the water–oil contact and the height where water saturation equals irreducible water saturation.
