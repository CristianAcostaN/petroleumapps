Classification Reservoir fluid type:
 
A reservoir is understood to be the geological unit with limited volume, which has a certain percentage of porosity and permeability, where the hydrocarbons are contained in a gaseous and liquid state. For the idea of reservoir to be formed, there must be five basic ingredients: (1) source, (2) Migratory path, (3) Trap, (4) Storage / porosity, (5) Transmissibility / Permeability (Escobar Macualo, 2012)
