Capillary pressure in a reservoir determines the saturation distribution, and hence the total in-situ volumes of fluids (oil/water/gas). Accurate knowledge of the capillary pressure distribution on drainage is one of the primary factors in the reliable estimation of hydrocarbon reserves. Imbibition capillary pressure is used to describe reservoir fluid displacement processes on production and to interpret the results of relative permeability experiments.
