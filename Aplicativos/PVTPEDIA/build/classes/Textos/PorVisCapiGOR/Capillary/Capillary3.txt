The above expression shows that capillary pressure in reservoirs depends on σ, the IFT between two immiscible fluids; θ, the contact angle between rock and fluid, which is a function of wettability; and r, pore radius, a microscopic rock property. An increase in pore radius leads to a decrease in Pc. Thus, high permeability rocks with relatively large pore radii have lower Pc than lower permeability rocks containing the same fluids.
