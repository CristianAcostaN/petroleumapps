Expressing Pc in terms of force down leads to the expression.

Solving for h yields the defining relationship between capillary pressure Pc and equivalent height h, namely,

The equivalent height is the height above the free fluid level of the wetting phase, where the free fluid level is the elevation of the wetting phase at Pc = 0. For example, Ahmed (2010) defines free water level as the elevation where capillary pressure equals zero at 100% water saturation with the waterâ€“oil contact at the uppermost depth in the reservoir where water saturation is 100%.
