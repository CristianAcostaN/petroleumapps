Also known as induced or vugular porosity. This is the name given to the porosity originated after the geological process of deposition of sediments for the formation of rocks. Therefore, this type of porosity can be classified as follows:

- Porosity formed by leaching action of groundwater: It is the porosity formed by the effect of erosion by groundwater and even this water can dissolve soluble materials leaving the empty space to the passage of water. It is known as leaching to the process of dragging by rainwater from superficial strata to deeper ones.

- Porosity by fracture: It is the porosity formed by the action of tectonic forces, this is known as diastrophism.

- Dolomitization porosity: This porosity originates from the substitution of a calcium molecule for a magnesium molecule, i.e. limestone rocks become dolomites, which are more porous rocks.
