Also known as intergranular or even as original porosity, this is the porosity that originates during the process of deposition of the sediments that give rise to the formation of the rocks, therefore the empty spaces left by the sediments after their original deposition is known as primary porosity. This process is typical of sedimentary rocks such as detrital sandstones and oolitic limestones.
