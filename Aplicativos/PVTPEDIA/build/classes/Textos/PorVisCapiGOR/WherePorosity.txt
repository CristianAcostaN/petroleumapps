These theoretical values of porosity are taken into account assuming that the grain is spherical in shape and by the geometric distribution that form the grains, from this information the pertinent definitions are applied, for example, making the mathematical demonstration for the packing of cubic type, where the volume of a cube and the volume of a sphere are taken into account, it would be as follows:
