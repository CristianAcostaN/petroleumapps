This classification refers to the isolation that can have the pores of the rocks, remember that the rock consists of grains and pores (empty spaces left by the grains) and a third element known as cementitious material, which is responsible for holding together the grains, when the cementitious material invades the pore, the space is obstructed losing communication with another pore, i.e., decreasing its porosity.
