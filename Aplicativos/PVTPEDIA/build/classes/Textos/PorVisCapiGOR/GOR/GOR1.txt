Total solution GOR is obtained from oil and gas sales data. In theory, the solution GOR is constant as long as the reservoir pressure is above the bubble-point pressure; in practice, however, some wells produce below the bubble-point pressure and therefore have higher producing GOR than solution GOR. It is usually advisable to make a plot of producing GOR versus time or cumulative oil production (the latter is preferred) to help determine a good value to use as initial solution GOR.
