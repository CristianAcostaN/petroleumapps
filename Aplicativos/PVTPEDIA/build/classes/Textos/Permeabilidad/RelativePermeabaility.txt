The concept of absolute permeability must be modified to describe the fluid flowing behavior when more than one fluid is present in the reservoir. 
As the saturation of a particular phase decreases, the permeability to that phase also decreases. The measured permeability is referred to as the effective permeability and is a relative measure of the conductance of the porous medium for one fluid when the medium is saturated with more than one fluid.
When two or more fluids flow at the same time, the relative permeability of each phase at a specific saturation is the ratio of the effective permeability of the phase to the absolute permeability.
