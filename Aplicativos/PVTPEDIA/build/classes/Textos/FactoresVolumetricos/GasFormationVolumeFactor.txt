The gas formation volume factor is used to relate the volume of gas, as measured at reservoir conditions, to the volume of the gas as measured at standard conditions, i.e., 60Â°F and 14.7 psia. This gas property is then defined as the actual volume occupied by a certain amount of gas at a specified pressure and temperature, divided by the volume occupied by the same amount of gas at standard conditions.
